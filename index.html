        <h4>About me</h4>
        <p>
          I'm a self-taught senior software developer, who has been creating and
          designing quality software for many years.
          <br />
          <br />
          I have played different roles, through my journey as a software
          developer such as web development, mobile development, designing
          complex systems, and so on.
          <br />
          <br />
          I'm very passionate about technology and software development, always
          trying to learn new things to improve my knowledge.
          <br />
          <br />
          My favorite programming language is Python but I have to admit that I
          love Javascript, these two amazing tools have been my main stack for
          many years, usually, combine them with my favorite web framework
          Django and my beloved web UI library React.
